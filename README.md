# Project-1-Team-10
The members/junior developers of this group project who created the application include: Julian Marshall, Ambrose Shokunbi and Ian Mohn.

First and foremost, we really took the time to outline different objectives and tasks that needed to be completed, as well as assigning roles to group members to ensure that we met the submission deadline. 
This interactive front-end project was interesting to create. The idea and mock-up for the project posed quite a few challenges, but after many hours and late nights, we were ultimately successful. This was also our first group project in the course, and the learning curve was great as this assignment allowed us to practice collaborating together as a development team.

For this group project, we chose to create and develop a dynamically interactive application that would cater to a target audience of sports-fans, specifically NBA Basketball enthusiasts. Specifically, we wanted to create an application that would allow the user to stay up-to-date with the stats, wins, losses, and national championship records of their favorite NBA Basketball team. 

Utlizing an sports API titled "balldontlie", we were able to create functions that would extract the values and ID's of a chosen team name(among a list of the 30 active NBA teams), and display the values for the name of the selected team, and the team's record of wins and losses that is specific to a single year that the user must select out of a list of 42 seasons dating from 1979 to 2021. 
The application has two drop-down menus, one for the list of team names and the other for the list of years. 
Before the user can click the submit button, they must select a specific team name and then select a year. The stats for the chosen team and season are displayed at the bottom of the page below the team's logo that is displayed above.
